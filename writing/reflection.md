# Reflection by

today I have learned more in the class then I have ever learned. I finally,
afte 3 weeks understand what a method is. I used the variable random number to
change bioinformatics. I used the method length. I also used the method
toUpperCase. I succesfully changed the DNA output.

With the Help of my amazing professor I was succesfully able to manipulate dna
ssequence. I now fully understand what a method is how to use it. I also know
how to used diffrent classes to import multiple methods. I was able to hold a
letter in the dna sequence until i could change it. I would like to say I'm
getting better.
